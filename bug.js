In React Router Dom v6, attempting to access the `location` object from within a component that's not directly a child of a `<Route>` or a custom hook that wraps the `useLocation` hook may lead to unexpected behavior or errors. This is because the `useLocation` hook is context-dependent and requires being within the routing context established by `<Route>`.  For instance, if you have nested components and try to access `location` in a deeply nested component that isn't directly under `<Route>`, it might return `undefined` or cause errors.  Another issue arises if you have a complex component structure and try using `useLocation` or `useParams` in a component rendered conditionally or inside a functional component without proper context.
