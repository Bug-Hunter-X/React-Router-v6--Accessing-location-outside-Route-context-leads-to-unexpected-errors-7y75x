This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using React Router v6: accessing the location object from outside the routing context. The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation. The error occurs because `useLocation` requires being within the routing context established by a `<Route>`. Incorrect usage leads to `location` being undefined or throwing errors.  The solution involves restructuring the component tree to ensure access within the routing context or creating a custom hook to manage context effectively.
